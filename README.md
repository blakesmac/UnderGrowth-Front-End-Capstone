Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The goal of this project was to create a React Application that showcases Front-End Developement skills and allows users to have a meaningful experience with the ideas I have implemented. 

## Requirements

This Project was completed within three to weeks at the end of my Front-End Bootcamp at Nashville Software School. Requirements were to create an application using the knowledge we were given of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React. We were also assigned to implement new technolgies as we see fit through our appliations. 

## About 

This application allows users to search through plants to find what is best for their garden and add them to their personal users plant page. It allows signed in users to create new plants for the database and also delete them if needed. The comment feature was also added to allow signed in users to write notes and messages about ay plant they wanted, or really any information they had and wanted to share about gardening. 

## Technology Implemented

The technologies that I ended up using were, React, React-Icons, React Bootstrap, Vanilla Javascript, JSX, and CSS to give it a personal style and simple feel inside the application.
